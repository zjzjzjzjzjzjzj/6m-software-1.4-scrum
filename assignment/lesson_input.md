### Self studies check-in

Q1: Describe the Waterfall Model.
```
The traditional project management model which emphasizes a liner and sequential progression from beginning to the end. There is very limited deviation to the set path.

Careful planning and very controlled execution is required to avoid heavy cost and schedule impact.

Suitable for projects with fixed requirements, an established timeline, well understood technology and unlikely to have significant changes to requirements

```

Q2: Describe the Agile Model.

```
Agile model is based on iterative development to deliver a project. It focuses on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every iteration in a rapid incremental cycle.

The entire project is divded into smaller parts or sprints to reduce the overall project deliverytime.

```


Q3: Describe the difference between Waterfall and Agile model.
```
Waterfall approach is strictly linear whereas Agile model encourages simulataneous work on different phases of the project.

Waterfall approach only works best for projects with very little need for changes (is rigid) whereas agile method can fasciliate rapid improvement and changes (very flexible).

## Activity Research 1


1. Test driven developement

```
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.

a- Add a test
b- Run all test.It should fail for expected reasons.
c- Write the simplest code. 
d-All test should pass
e-Refactor as needed, using test after each refractor to ensure functionality is preserved

```

## Activity Research 2

1. Scrum artifacts

```
Agile scrum artifacts are information that a scrum team and stakeholders use to detail the product being developed, actions to produce it, and the actions performed during the project. The main agile scrum artifacts are product backlog, sprint backlog, and increments.
```

2. Product backlog

```
- An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
- Important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first
- During Sprint Planning, product backlog items that can be worked on during that sprint are selected
- Product Backlog refinement: the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. Not mandatory and it can occur at any time during a Sprint.

- Prevents teams from idling
- Gives the team extra time on projects that aren't a priority
- A view into the backlog can also provide a preview of what's to come. It allows technical teams to begin thinking about how they might implement those items.


```

3. Sprint backlog

```



```

4. Product increment

```
- It is what gets produced at the end of a development period of timebox, they take place between teams and sprints within teams. - Program increments are scaled sprints at an enterprise level. - The purpose of Product increment is to be able to invest in new features of the product in small amounts on a regular basis, which helps to shorten the time before feedback is received. 

```


## Class Activity

1. What are user stories

```
A user story is an informal, plain language explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how the software features will provide value to the end user. It puts the user in the center of discussion of what to add or change in a software product.

```

2. Why user stories

```
User stories keep the focus on the user and keeps the developer team focused on solving the problems for real user. The stories encourage the team to think critically and creatively on how to the best solution for the problem. With user stories, the developement team is given the context and the reason of the features they are creating to provide value for the business and keep the user as the priority.

```

3. Provide example of user stories

```
As a [person who relies heavily on ride sharing to get around throughout the day] i want to [use a fast and reliable ride hailing app ] so that [i can quickly hail a vehicle to move from my current location to my destination]. 

Once i have selected my destination and choice of transport, the app can immediately find the nearest vehicle and connect me with the driver. I can know the exact location/status of the vehicle and ETA to my location for my pickup. I can contact the driver at any given time via the app in case something happens. 

The app can smoothly track the journey to destination and automatically deduct the fare from my app credit. I can also provide feedback/review on the driver after the trip.

As a customer, i want to [select the type of car/ride] so that [I can ensure the vehicle that picks me up suits my comfort needs]

As a user, I want to have options of choosing my payment method in terms of cash, card or payment through app, so that we no need to tie down to only 1 method of payment mode

As a [person who is planning my trip] i want to[ be able to find out how long does the journey takes and its route] so that [i can estimate and plan ahead my activities upon reaching my destination]

```

As a [customer who used the ride hailing services] i want to [be able to leave a review on the driver's services on the app publically] so that [i can  share/reward the driver for his/her good services]
